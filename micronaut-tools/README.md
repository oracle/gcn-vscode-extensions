- The [Extension Pack for Java from Microsoft](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscjava.vscode-java-pack).
VS Code will prompt you to install the extension when you open a Micronaut project (for more information, see [Java in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/java)).
- (Optional.) The A Java Development Kit (JDK) installation (JDK 17 or later).
[Oracle GraalVM](https://www.oracle.com/java/graalvm/) is a fast and efficient JDK from Oracle.

## Installing the Extension
Click **Install** on the banner above, or from the Extensions side bar in VS Code, by searching for "Micronaut Tools".

You can also find the extension listed on the [VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=oracle-labs-graalvm.micronaut).

The Micronaut Tools page opens as soon as the extension is installed.
You can also open this page using the Command Palette command **Micronaut Tools: Show Micronaut Tools Page**.

> Note: This extension is part of the [Graal Cloud Native Extensions Pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=oracle-labs-graalvm.graal-cloud-native-pack). We recommend you install the Graal Cloud Native Extensions Pack as it provides additional extensions for Micronaut development, including the [Micronaut Launch](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=oracle-labs-graalvm.micronaut) extension.

## Usage

### View Suggested Code Completions

The extension suggests code completions for your YAML configuration files.
(The available configuration properties and their values are collected by scanning your source code and the Micronaut libraries.)

The extension also provides code completion for your Java source code via the [Extension Pack for Java from Microsoft](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscjava.vscode-java-pack).
This gives you all the IDE features that you would expect from [IntelliSense](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/intellisense), as well as automatically highlighting errors as you type.

### Navigate Micronaut Source Code

You can easily navigate to Micronaut-specific elements of your source code via the **Go to Symbol in Workspace** command.

Run the **Go to Symbol in Workspace** command using Ctrl+T (Cmd+T on macOS) and enter the prefix:
* `@/` to show all defined request mappings
* `@+` to show all defined beans

![Navigate Micronaut Source Code](images/micronaut-navigation.png)

### View Defined Beans and Endpoints
All beans and request mappings defined by a Micronaut or GCN application can be displayed in the Beans and Endpoints views of the Micronaut Tools activity.

The items of these views can be searched/filtered using a dedicated action available in the view captions, or invoked using the Ctrl+F shortcut.

Clicking a node in one of these views navigates to the corresponding source code similar to the Go to Symbol in Workspace command. This can be also invoked using a dedicated context menu action:
* **Go to Symbol** to open the bean or request mapping source code

Request mapping nodes in the Endpoints view provide two additional actions:
* **Open in Browser** to open the GET endpoint in a web browser
* **Compose REST Query** to insert the corresponding query into a dedicated text document. See the following section Compose REST Queries for details.

Similar actions are available also in the code editor as Code Lens actions.

For endpoints containing parameters a dialog is opened to provide concrete values before opening in a browser or generating a REST query. Tip: type a parameter value and submit by Enter to move to another parameter.

The base address of the running Micronaut or GCN application is by default configured to `http://localhost:8080` and can be customized using the Edit Target Application Address action in the Endpoints view caption or next to a folder node in case multiple folders are opened in the workspace.

![Beans and Endpoints views](images/beans_endpoints_view.png)


### Compose REST Queries
To easily debug and test the application REST API, the Endpoints view provides a smooth integration with a third party extension [REST Client](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=humao.rest-client).

To start composing a REST query, invoke the Compose REST Query action for an endpoint either from the Endpoints view or using the corresponding Code Lens action in code editor. A dedicated text document is opened and the corresponding query is inserted. Use the REST Client features to invoke and process the query.

Note: If the REST Client extension is not installed when invoking the Compose REST Query action, a notification is displayed offering to quick install it.

![Compose REST Query](images/compose_rest_query.png)

### Run Your Micronaut Application

The easiest way to run your Micronaut application is to view the `Application` class in the editor and click **Run** above the `main()` method, as shown here.

![Run Micronaut Application](images/run_main_method.png)

Alternatively, select **Run Without Debugging** from the **Run** menu.

### Live Reloading of Applications

Micronaut has the ability to automatically recompile and restart your application (or its parts) when it detects changes to your source code.
(This is called "Continuous Mode".)
To run your Micronaut application in this mode, view the `Application` class in the editor and click **Run with Micronaut Continuous Mode** above the `main()` method, as shown here.

![Run Micronaut Application in Continuous Mode](images/run-continuous.png)

Alternatively, select **Run and Debug** in the activity bar and click **create a launch.json file**.
When prompted, select **Java** as the debugger.
A configuration that will be labeled with "Continuous" will be created for your Micronaut application main class(es), similar to this example:
![Select Launch Configuration to Run Micronaut Application in Continuous Mode](images/run-continuous-config.png)

Select the newly added configuration in the **Run and Debug** view, and finally click **Run**.

### Debug Your Micronaut Application

The easiest way to run your Micronaut application is to view the `Application` class in the editor and click **Debug** above the `main()` method, as shown here.

![Debug Micronaut Application](images/debug_main_method.png)

Alternatively, select **Start Debugging** from the **Run** menu.

### Package Your Micronaut Application

To package your application as a runnable JAR file, follow these steps:

1. Select **Command Palette** from the **View** menu.
Enter "Micronaut Tools" and invoke the **Micronaut Tools: Build...** command.

2. Select the **compile** build goal from a list of available goals.

    ![Micronaut Build Commands](images/micronaut-build-commands.png)

3. When the compilation completes, invoke the **Micronaut Tools: Build...** command again.
This time, select the **package** goal, which will package your application into a JAR file.

### Create a Native Executable from Your Micronaut Application

If you have installed Oracle GraalVM, you can use GraalVM Native Image to create a native executable from your application.
GraalVM Native Image creates an executable file with all the application classes, dependent library classes, dependent JDK classes, and a snapshot of the application heap. 
Whilst building a native executable can take some time, the benefits include a dramatic reduction in startup time and reduced overall memory consumption.

> **Note**: The time to build an executable depends on application size and complexity.

To create a native executable, follow these steps:

1. Select **Command Palette** from the **View** menu.
Enter "Micronaut Tools" and invoke the **Micronaut Tools: Build...** command.

2. Select the **compile** build goal from a list of available goals.

    ![Micronaut Build Commands](images/micronaut-build-commands.png)

3. When the compilation completes, invoke the **Micronaut Tools: Build...** command again.
This time, select the **nativeImage** goal, which creates a native executable from your application.

    * If your application is built with Maven, the goal runs the command `mvnw package -Dpackaging=native-image`.
    The resulting native executable will in the _target/native-image/_ directory.

    * If your application is built with Gradle, the goal runs the command `gradlew nativeCompile`.
    The resulting native executable will in the _build/native/nativeCompile/_ directory.

To run your Micronaut application as a native executable, open a terminal by selecting **New Terminal** from the **Terminal** menu, then run the following command: 

* If you used Maven: `./target/<executable-name>`
* If you used Gradle: `./build/native/nativeCompile/<executable-name>`

For more information, see the [Micronaut documentation](https://guides.micronaut.io/latest/micronaut-creating-first-graal-app.html).

> **Note**: If you are using VS Code on the Windows platform, invoke the **Micronaut Tools: Build Native Image** command from the Command Palette. 

### Build a Container Image and Deploy Your Micronaut Application to a Container Registry

You can build a container image of your Micronaut application, or create a container image of an executable created by GraalVM Native Image.
You can then deploy the container image.

To build and deploy a container image of your application, follow these steps:

1. Select **Command Palette** from the **View** menu.
Enter "Micronaut Tools" and invoke the **Micronaut Tools: Deploy...** command.

2. Select select one of the goals from the list:
    - To deploy a containerized Micronaut application, select the **dockerPush** goal.
    - To deploy a containerized native executable, select the **dockerPushNative** goal.

To configure your application's container registry, see the documentation for [Micronaut Maven Plugin](https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-maven-plugin/latest/)/[Micronaut Gradle Plugin](https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-gradle-plugin/latest/). 

### Deploy Your Application to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure

**Prerequisites:**
* An Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) account.
* The [OCI DevOps Tools extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=oracle-labs-graalvm.oci-devops) (part of the [Graal Cloud Native Extension Pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=oracle-labs-graalvm.graal-cloud-native-pack)).

The OCI DevOps Tools extension provisions build and deployment pipelines for:
* An OCI native executable container: a containerized native executable
* An OCI Java container: a containerized Micronaut application

It can also provision a cluster to run your container on Oracle's [Container Engine for Kubernetes](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/ContEng/Concepts/contengoverview.htm).
For more information about using the OCI DevOps Tools Extension, see [Using OCI DevOps Tools Extensions in VS Code](https://www.graal.cloud/gcn/get-started/using-gcn-vscode-tools/).

## Troubleshooting
This extension modifies Run for **Java** environment so that the application is launched using the build system (Gradle, Maven). These are so called *Code lenses* shown above `main()` method `Run | Debug | Run with Micronaut Continuous Mode`. In some scenarios the support may not support all customizations necessary for the user project and has to be turned off.

To enable or disable the enhanced Run feature, navigate to `File - Preferences - Settings`, locate `Micronaut Tools` extension section and turn on/off the `Use build system to run or debug applications`. The relevant setting (in JSON format) is `micronaut-tools.buildsystemExecution`

In some configurations of VSCode extensions Enhanced Run feature - code lenses for Micronaut and GCN applications `Run | Debug | Run with Micronaut Continuous Mode` are not displayed for **Gradle** projects when **Gradle for Java extension** is Enabled. In such a case it is necessary to disable Gradle for Java extension, reload VSCode and then enable Gradle for Java again. After this action Enhanced Run feature starts working and code lenses `Run | Debug | Run with Micronaut Continuous Mode` appears.

Apache NetBeans Language Server for Java does not work on Linux and macOS when VSCode extensions directory contains space in path, e.g. `/User/great code/.vscode/extensions`. This extension depends on Apache NetBeans Lang Server. Extensions directory is where all VSCode extensions are installed. Default location is:
* Windows `%USERPROFILE%\.vscode\extensions`
* macOS `~/.vscode/extensions`
* Linux `~/.vscode/extensions`

This location can be changed to path without space:
* Permanently by setting environment variable `VSCODE_EXTENSIONS` for OS shell (bash, zsh, sh,...) modifying corresponding profile file (`.bash_profile`, `.zshrc`,...). Or
* Temporarily by launching VSCode from command line with switch `--extensions-dir`, e.g. `$ code --extensions-dir "/User/code_user/extensions_dir"`
* It cannot be changed in VSCode Settings.
