# Description
This module is intended to unify usage of code across multiple Oracle Labs Extensions to avoid duplicate code and problems like bug fixes applied on code only in some Extensions.

# Usage
This module has to built first to be used see [Building](#building).
After building this module all packages can be accessed by importing them directly from _lib_ folder of the module.
```typescript
import * as <package> from '<vscode-extensions>/common/lib/<package>';
```
or
```typescript
import { <imported> } from '<vscode-extensions>/common/lib/<package>';
```
Where _<vscode_extensions>_ means navigating to the top/parent folder.

# Building
To build this module use one of these commands:

```bash
.../vscode-extensions $> npm run build:common
```
```bash
.../vscode-extensions/common $> npm run build
```
This module is also build in prebuild step of base package so it is prepared before building rest of the Extensions.

# Extending
Whenever you encounter a need to use code from another extension, find duplicate or unifiable code in Extensions make use of this module to reference the code from single source.
- The code that can be moved to this module has to be **not** coupled to Extensions functionality or the functionality has to be also movable to this module.
- Make sure to move the code to proper package or create suitable package for the code.
- [Build](#building) the module with new code, this will allow you to access new code from the Extensions.
- [Redirect all imports and usages](#usage) to the modules package.
- Dependencies can be added to this module in _package.json_ but some (Node) modules need to have fallback resolved in _webpack.config.js_ of extension using the code:
```js
resolve: {
  fallback: {
    "fs": false,
    "os": false,
    "path": false,
    "child_process": false
  }
}
```
- Be aware that `tsc` command will pick _index.d.ts_ files from common package if included (this makes a raid condition on type resolution), to avoid this behavior you have to specify where it should pick the types from in _tsconfig.json_ file of extension using the type:
```json
"compilerOptions": {
  ...
  "baseUrl": ".",
  "paths": {
    "<type>": ["node_modules/@types/<type>"]
  }
}
```
- Please include [description of shared functionality](#packages) here in this README for easy lookup.
